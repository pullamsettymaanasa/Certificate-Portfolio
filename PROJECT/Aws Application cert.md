# About This Project
I built and deployed a basic cloud application using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.  
Even though I used the free tier and deleted the resources later, I got hands-on experience in real-world cloud setup.
 
# Services Used
- **EC2** – to launch a virtual server  
- **S3** – to store and manage static files  
- **RDS** – for database needs  
- **Route53** – to manage DNS and routing  
- **CloudFront** – to deliver content globally with speed

# What I Learned
- How to host a full-stack web app on the cloud  
- How AWS services integrate in real use cases  
- How to manage and clean up resources to avoid billing

# Duration
Completed in **June 2024** using AWS Free Tier.
